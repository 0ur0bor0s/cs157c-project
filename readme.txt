Our project makes use of the following pip packages:
- pymongo
- nltk

When installing nltk, the packages requires another download.
To do this, run the included standalone script, install_nltk.py
using the following command:

python3 install_nltk.py

The application will then run properly with the following command:

python3 dataset_query.py
